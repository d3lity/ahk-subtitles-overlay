Autohotkey script for showing subtitles over video
==================================================

Why :
* while watching from browser (flash/Divx/etc.) you can't just easily load subtitles on the player (like in VLC or others)
* movies/shows have sometimes languages used that you don't really understand (french, spanish, ..)

How to use
==========
You have have Autohotkey (http://www.autohotkey.com/) installed. I believe it requires Windows operating system.

- drop .srt or .sub -file over the script and it should start playing subtitles
- match subtitle playing with movie/show
- keys:
	1		Delay subtitles (if they come too early)
	2		Forward subs (when it comes too late)
	3		.sub Less delay (if subtitles seem to be getting behind, tried adjusting with 2)
	4		.sub More delay (if subtitles seem to be getting earlier, and you have to adjust with 1)
	q		smaller font-size
	w		larger font-size
	a		higher from the bottom of the screen
	s		lower towards the bottom of the screen
	§		Exit script (also by clicking Exit from trayicon)
	
settings.ini
============
File with default program settings in it.

TODO
====
- add some kind of gui for easier interaction
- support for more subtitle formats
