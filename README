Autohotkey script for showing subtitles over video
==================================================

Why and why not:
+ put subtitles "on" while streaming with browser (flash/Divx/etc.), that is, if you have the file for it
+ foreign videos/shows use languages that you don't know
+ Can be huge help for hearing impaired (hopefully)
+ easy to use (maybe some day, if not yet)
+ very light and tiny program
+ you can use different subtitles while whatching DVDs, other than included ones
- fast forwarding or jumping in timeline -> very hard to keep subs synced
- seperate controls for subtitles, so if you decide to pause movie, you got to pause subtitles also
- Program can't be used for simultaneus translating or burning texts to your streams


How to use
==========
You have to have Autohotkey (http://www.autohotkey.com/) installed. I believe it requires Windows operating system.

- drag & drop .srt or .sub -file over the script and it should start playing subtitles
- carefully match subtitle playing with video
- keys:
	1		Delay subtitles (if they come too early)
	2		Forward subs (when they come too late)
	3		(.sub) Less delay (if subtitles seem to be getting behind, and have tried adjusting with 2)
	4		(.sub) More delay (if subtitles seem to be getting earlier, and you have to adjust with 1)
	q		smaller font-size
	w		larger font-size
	a		higher from the bottom of the screen
	s		lower towards the bottom of the screen
	p		Pause subtitle playing (so you could go bathroom while watching long movies)
	x		Exit script (also by clicking Exit from trayicon)

If keys overlap on some keyboard commands that you use during watching, you could change them by editing script-file.
	

settings.ini
============
File with default program settings in it. You can change these to your liking with text editor.


TODO
====
- add some kind of GUI for easier interaction
- support for more subtitle formats
